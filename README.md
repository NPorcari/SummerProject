Summer Projects for Haxbox

Summer Projects is the repository for all of the summer projects performed for and under the supervision of Bansen Labs.

It should contain material covered by the course of Mechatronics, as the initial weeks were devoted to a crash course of 
mechatronics, circuits and the learning of Python and C programming languages.
